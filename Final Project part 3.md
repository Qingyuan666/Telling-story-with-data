# Writeup:
1. Process:
I confirmed the higher education topic at the first part, but from the professor's feedback of the part 1 and part 2, I find the my original plan of only talking about the post-secondary education rate in PA cannot contribute to a story and no motivation of an audience of to get to know that so I change to talk more about the major choosing targeted at the audience of pending and early undergraduate students.

2. Audience:
The audience is mainly the pending and early undergraduate students who are in front of confirming their career pathway in the future. From my data story, they begin by establishing a perception that 'choosing a satisfied and rational major' is not easy (many people regret), which evokes the importance of deep thinking about choosing major. Then the audience can get to know the data support if they want to  see the most popular and high return fields. And then the story also tries to broaden their mindset unlimited in the common popular and salary standards. After that, they will establish a beginning mindset of thinking major and they will be linked to a website for exploring more about how to choose major.

3. Summary
The data storytelling is designed along the logic of throwing out a phenomenon, evoking the importance perception of exploring it deeply. Then, firstly, give some common and normal perspectives and broaden the reader's mindset to rethink about major. I don't think my purpose of data storytelling is strong persuasion because the major chosen topic is diverse and customized for different people. What I want to is providing supportive information and logic guidence.

The aesthetical design: the whole style of the story is prone to old and classical Gothic school's style.

Observation:
1) The most popular major in the US is business even though the starting salary is not outstanding, much lower than computer science and engineering.
2) The communication and visual art majors are not paid well but still appear in the top 10 popular majors. 
3) In the top ten highest-paid work, surprisingly, no one out of the range of technology, science, and engineering.
4) The extremely bottom salary major is most related to art.
5) However, in the top 10 industries with the happiest workers, a wide range of fields appear just with one is about engineering.
