# Asssignment 2- Summary
The differences between the two data visualization ways
1. The part2 visualization and part3 visualization all show the entire values along all locations and all time points. From the information offering part, they are the same. However, the first way shows the all data centralized at the same position, making the user directly get all information without any scrolling or other deeds. By contrast, part 3 way divides the data into different location cells, needing the user to scroll to find the location they want.
2.  The part2 visualization just uses numbers to show the changes of debt-to-gdp ratio along the time passing but the part3 use line to show the changing tendency of ratio from 1994-2020.
3.  The two ways all use color transforming between two spectrum color to indicate the values from low to high. However, the former one can put the different color cells of different locations together which make the color extent comparison very obvious. The second way separates the different locations so the close color extends cannot be put together for comparing.

Why part 3 way:
1. The row data contains many items for both x-axis and y-axis, time and location perspectives. If we put all information in the same layer at the same place, coming to the user's sight together. It seems too dense for user and too complex to quickly find individual information. Therefore, I try to divide the data into different locations, aiming at helping the user quickly track to the targeted location they want to see and the general visualization effect also becomes more clear and concise. 
2. Dividing the different locations into separate cells weakens the comparison among different locations from both overall and certain time points. So I retain the hot map's color transforming of values. Seeing locations' lines' general color distribution prone to blue or orange can tell the general ratio's distribution range, high or low. Scrolling from up to down, also unfold the ratio contrast at the same time.
3. Based on our audience demands, checking the tendency and changing of one location's debt-to-GDP ratio must be important for analyzing the economic and government financial operation of a country. In this way, using lines rather than just number is vital for the visualization. I also test the way of putting all locations' lines in the same chart. Unfortunately, it will make so many collapse that confuse the user to distinguish which line is which location. Thus, at last, I choose this separate way.
   
# Assignment 3&4

Original Data :
https://gml.noaa.gov/aggi/aggi.html
I Mainly redesign the firgure 3 chart 
<img width="990" alt="截屏2023-11-15 上午2 09 16" src="https://github.com/Qingyuan666/Telling-story-with-data/assets/115184503/6409a5e8-fe8f-4f38-a656-2e44c7be6ae4">


Original data visualization critique:
In this part, I first read the questions in Google form and took them to understand the original data visualization. 


Redesign Sketch:
Based on what I find in the critique part, I conclude the main problems of the original visualization are:
1. non-interactive causing no concrete data information given by chart;
2. not easily figure out the two y-axis means in the same chart and the possible data tortuosity when matching the two y-axises in one chart.
3. Cannot quickly get to know what the radiative forcing value and the AGGI value means just seeing the chart.

Therefore, for redesign sketching, I plan to change the cumulative color area chart into an interactive, cumulative bar chart providing all data points of all years along all greenhouse gases and shown the obviouse contrast between total and each type of gas. Simultaneously, I want to divide the aggi and the radiative forcing value into two charts.

![sketch](https://github.com/Qingyuan666/Telling-story-with-data/assets/115184503/2ee6b9d7-ba50-41a6-883a-5ac94b08ee44)


The handwriting sketch cannot truly show all 40+ years and all concrete tags, marks, and interactive effects on every bar, but I express the core meanings of what I want to do in the redesign and show the picture to my teammates with language explanation. 
They understood and gave me the advice as follows. 

Solution Test:
1. No title and text explanation of the two metrics in y-axises;
2. The radiative forcing value for all greenhouse gases may be more important than the aggi so the high and low position of the two parts should be converted.
3. If as I think, giving line at the frontier of each of the gas' bar area. The visual effect will be very dense especially I put all gas types on in the final version and the frontier of bars can show the changing tendency along the past years. So I should eliminate the line of each types just remain that one of total.

Summary
Following the feedback from my teammates, I conducted the final version of the redesign in tableau and found a new problem the gas types with the least proportion in greenhouse gas produce a very small part of the cumulative bar so they will be partly covered by the total value line. Unfortunately, I have not found a good solution for this problem because if I want the total data can be shown in the chart I must use a line of it. If I also use a cumulative bar of the total, the total part cannot be compared with each type of gas and make clear that all types construct to the total one. So I choose to remain the current look with some layer hidden. 

My final version of data visualization achieves the following items:
1. Aiming at showing the aggi and radiative forcing two different values more clearly and making the user figure out there are two types of metrics, I split the two things into two chart parts. This point originates from the perceptibility in the measuring system. 
2. In order to show the different greenhouse gas proportions constructed to the total, I made a cumulative bar chart for each type shown in different colors and used a line to show the total greenhouse value. In this way, we can clearly figure out the different percentages of different greenhouse gases in the total. And the interactive way can provide each time point's concrete and entire information by moving the mouse to there. This way is for usefulness, completeness, and perceptibility. 
3. At the aggi part, I add a markable tag to show when the ratio is 1 and let the use know what are above 1 and lower than 1.
4. In deciding the color usage of bar chart, I do not choose to use transforming color because the different areas showing big and small very clearly of those types, which does not need use transforming color to show different types of gas' high or low proportion. Within one type, using transforming color to show high or low in different year is ok but this will cause too many different colors in the chart. It will cause messy visual effects so I give up it. The color choosing depends on the aesthetics and usefulness principles.
5. I added the explanation of the two y-values as a subtitle of the chart and made the title of the chart telling very simple and concise things to help the user quickly know what is the chart generally about. It is for intuitiveness and perceptibility.
