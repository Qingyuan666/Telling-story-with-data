Interview Script:
Introduction:
Hello, this is my data story of the education situation after high school in Pennsylvania. It tells about the several destination, continuing or not continuing education after high shool of the students from public school in 2021-2022. 

Main part:
Firstly, we all know accepting education is important but do you know how does a higher education make a great impact on ourselves and the whole society? 
Oh, let's see about that, as we can see the average income gap between people without or without a college degree at the same age. 
Then the market demand for jobs needing postsecondary education increased.
For society, there is also data showing the higher education's impact on government finances and social economy development. 

wow, for such a significant and interesting social situation, do you want to know more about the concrete data details in Pennsylvania? Let's unfold this problem from general, gender, race, and county dimensions. 

At last, are you curious about the correlation between different postsecondary education and the local economy? We can see there...

Question:
1. How do you think about the whole story?
2. Can you clearly understand everything in that, do you have any points vague?
3. Do you feel comfortable to understand the data visualization?
4. Do you feel enough of the information provided, is there anything you still wan to know?
5. What do you think about the logic and storytelling tactics ?
6. How do you think about the visual effect of the whole process?

# Findings 
first student:
1. the relation with average income is the good and attractive point but the only one simple line chart
   with so many data points cannot communicate out the effects and results.
2. the investment return graph in the first part seems wired to make sure what the two tangle means.

Second student:
1. there are too many colors and elements on the chart of racial higher education rate. This makes people confused at the same glance.
2. In this chart, you do not give what the transforming color means.
3. There are too many different kind or extents of colors in one color in the whole report. It can be more uniform.

Third Student:
1. The county data map may can add the three lowest postsecondary education rate areas.
2. there is no reference to data.
3. There is no icons or other insert can be supportive for story telling 


# Changes:
I have done:
1. add reference;
2. adjust the mess color usage.

I plan to do:
1. redesign some visual pages combined with some icons.
2. research for a better way to indicate the higher education investment return;
3. change the economic relation part to show more clear and simpler relation between average income
   and postsecondary education rate.
4. clean up the racial distribution chart with less concise visualization.
